I'm a final year student currently persuing my Bachlors in Mechanical Engineering at Odisha University of Technology and Research. I'm learning how to code. I love making and designing and working on responsive and innovative web applications. I also enjoy programming in C++ to solve problems related to Data Structures and Algorithms.

For my programming projects, I usually only upload to Github once I make significant progress. For markdown files, I make commits much more often. Feel free to create a pull request to contribute to any of my repositories.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, NodeJS and C++.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating webpages and learning how to programme.
- ðŸ˜€ I like to crochet, code, read, and draw in my free time.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about tech.
- âš¡ Fun fact: My first line of code was not "Hello World!"
